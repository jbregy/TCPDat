The other dataset required is the Climate Prediction Center Unified
Guage-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation over CONUS (CPC US Unified)
from the Physical Sciences Division of the Earth Systems Research
Laboratory. The latest version can be found here:

(Note: the years 2007 onward are located in the RT subfile. CPC started doing something different.
It's inconvenient, but such is life.) Like IBTrACS, CPC US Unified should be a netCDF. You will have to
download gridded precipitation for each year that you are interested in.
The script is written to cover every year starting at 1948 (per CPC US
Unified). In future iterations, I plan to have query statements that
allow you to define your time range, but plans always look great on paper.
Anyway, cite CPC US Unified accordingly.
